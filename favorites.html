          When I am not at school or work, my favorite hobbies include listening to music, playing video games, and
          going to the gym. I've always enjoyed listening to music, but I started to branch out my tastes into
          alternative artists during quarantine. It's now my favorite form of art and a great way to get to know
          someone. I also enjoy playing video games, mainly with friends. I don't play as much as I used to, but
          currently I enjoy playing League of Legends and Fortnite. Working out is another hobby of mine, which I got
          into per a friend's recommendation. I enjoy working out a lot due to the physical and mental effects of
          exercise in general - it makes you feel a <em>lot</em> better! It's also another hobby that is very enjoyable
          with friends.

          I'm a big fan of alternative and experimental music. One of my favorite artists is Aphex Twin, shown in the
          photo. Others include Bladee, Bjork, My Bloody Valentine, and Panchiko. Listen to Aphex Twin's 'Avril 14th'

        <div class="favsText">
          Weightlifting is another favorite hobby of mine. While I am still relatively new, I've had a great time going
          to the gym, especially with friends. It's very fun once you create a routine that you can stick to. I
          recommend this hobby a lot due to how rewarding and engaging it is.

          My favorite animal is the Serval cat. These cats are native to Africa and roam savannahs and wetlands. These
          cats not only very cute, but very intelligent as well. While I found out about serval cats through domestic
          owners, it's not recommended to own them as pets due to their wild nature and our inability to properly care
          for them. However, there are servals who have been domesticated over generations and have owners that properly
          care for their needs, such as lots of exercise and whole prey meals.<br><br>&copy; Alem Bicic 2022
