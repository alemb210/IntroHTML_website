          A skill that I can teach is converting between number bases. Understanding number bases is important in both
          engineering and programming.

          Binary is a number system which uses two values, 1 and 0, to represent on and off states. It is the system
          used by all electronics. As shown to the right, the number 11010 in binary is equal to 32 in octal. We can
          convert by taking groups of 3 digits, starting from the right, and matching them to a conversion table. In the
          number 010, only the second digit is 'on', so the value is equal to 2^1 or 2. Then, we take the next group,
          which is only 2 numbers. Because both the first and second digits are 'on', or 1s, the value is equal to 2^0 +
          2^1 or 3. Concatenating these values gives us the number 32 in octal. This conversion works because binary is
          base 2 and octal is base 8, and 2^3 = 8.<br>
        </p>

        <p>
          Octal is a number which uses digits from 0-7 to represent values. To convert from octal to binary, it's much
          like
          the opposite conversion. You can convert octal to binary by taking each digit in the octal number, from right
          to left,
          and matching it to an equivalent three-digit binary string. As shown in the picture to the right, 32 in octal
          can be
          converted to 11010. Because 2 in binary is equal to 010 (leading 0 for three digits) and 3 is equal to 11 (no
          leading 0),
          concatenating the two gives us the binary number 11010.
