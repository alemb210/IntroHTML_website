        <p>About Me<br><br>My name is Alem B., I'm a senior at Brooklyn Tech in the Software Engineering major. When I
          am not in school, my hobbies include listening to music, working out, and playing video games. I currently
          work in IT at a law firm but I am hoping to start working in the field of software as I make the shift into
          college. At the moment, I am aiming to get a bachelor's degree in Computer Science from a university that is
          relatively close to home, such as Hunter College or SBU.</p>

        <p>BTHS<br><br>The school I attend is Brooklyn Technical High School. I got accepted in March of 2019<br>with
          a ~530 SHSAT score. BTHS has a lot of flaws that come with a school of it's size,<br>but ultimately, I
          believe the major system makes it a very good school to attend if you<br>are already planning on working in a
          certain field. This year, I get to take classes such<br>as web development and database management, which I
          never would have expected<br>to take in high school.</p>

        <p>My Life<br><br>I was born on February 10, 2005. I grew up with two older sisters in the West<br>Village
          of Manhattan (shown right). I have always really liked my neighborhood due<br>to the scenery and relative
          quietness to the rest of the city. I would argue that you<br>get the benefits of living in NYC without a lot
          of the cons.

        Welcome to my site!

        This is my first project for Mr. Irmina's Web Development course of the 2022-2023 school year.

        How I made this site
      </h1>
      <p class="indexText">
        I used HTML to structure this web page and CSS to style and organize the elements. Using a separate stylesheet
        made the process very smooth and organized. Creating this website taught me many things, such as
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>structuring divs, child and parent</li>
        <li>CSS flex and block displays</li>
        <li>how to effectively use % values to section a web page</li>
      </ul>
