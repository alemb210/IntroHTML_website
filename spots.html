          Pier 57 is a rooftop pier located along the Hudson River. It was opened very recently in April of 2022. The
          rooftop portion features multiple floors to view the Hudson River to the west, as well as Little Island,
          another recent public project, to the south. The view is immaculate, especially as the sun sets. This park is
          definitely the best during summertime, but the next two spots can cover you year-round!

          The Brooklyn Bridge is another great spot in NYC. A fun daytime activity is walking across the bridge from the
          Manhattan side into the Brooklyn neighborhood of Dumbo. Not only is the view from the bridge fascinating, but
          the surrounding neighborhood in Brooklyn has wonderful piers and restaurants.<br><br><br><br>&copy; Alem Bicic
